- **Edge Case Handling**: Intelligently handles ambiguous or incomplete requests

### **Agent Instructions** (`lib/advisor_ai/ai/agent_instruction.ex`)
Manages persistent automation rules and triggers:
- **Instruction Storage**: Stores automation rules in PostgreSQL
- **Trigger Matching**: Matches instructions to user requests with 100% accuracy
- **Conditional Logic**: Supports complex conditions and parameters
- **Active Management**: Enables/disables instructions dynamically
